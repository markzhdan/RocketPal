# Rocket Pal

***Project Description***

RocketPal is a comphrehensive coding project that is aimed at fostering healthy well being and mental health through daily tracking of goals and tasks. The application provides users with a platform to set some goals for themselves, and our platform creates tasks that cater to the goals the user entered and the journals the user has written so far. Users can maintain daily journals to reflect on their progress and experiences. A unique feature of our RocketPal is you have your very own personal AI therapist, which offers advice tailored to address individual concerns or challenges. As users complete tasks, progress is made towards their specific goals, symbolized by their rocket moving closer to the stars. Ultimately, when all goals are achieved, users' rockets reach their final destination for the day, signifying a successful journey towards improved well-being.
